# Can-i-be-an-influencer-Datathon-23-NEU

This Kaggle competition is organized by the Data Science Hub, Northeastern University in collaboration with Kaggle Days and Institute of Experiential AI as supporting organizations and Graduate Student Government, Northeastern as sponsors.

This competition aims to solve the challenge of predicting whether a photograph is likely to be popular and generate a significant number of downloads. Participants will be provided with a dataset containing various features of photographs such as the camera type, location, lighting conditions, and other image-specific characteristics. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the lifetime download count of an image based on these features
